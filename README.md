# retirejs
A cli tool for retirejs written in golang - aka a single binary!

## Usage
```shell
retirejs http://example.com
retirejs ~/vcs/test
```

## Todo
- Report formats
- Check sha1 
- Use headless chrome to scrape versions from DOM
- Receive from stdin pipe
- Web directory listing of assets handling
- *Maybe* npm modules? (npm audit does this but single binary is *muy bien*)
